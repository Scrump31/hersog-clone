# HERSOG Design to Responsive Layout

For this project I am building a responsive layout based on a [dribbble design](https://dribbble.com/shots/1503257-Web-Design/attachments/226195)

Currently, I am building a mobile version of the design with plans to eventually build tablet, and desktop friendly versions.

Live demos coming soon...
