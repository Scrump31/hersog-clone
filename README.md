For this project I built a responsive layout based on a [dribbble design](https://dribbble.com/shots/1503257-Web-Design/attachments/226195)


### Technologies used:
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Webpack2](https://webpack.github.io/)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [eslint](http://eslint.org/)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
